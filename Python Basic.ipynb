What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It is popular due to:\n","Extensive libraries and frameworks.\n","Strong community support.\n","Versatility in various domains (web development, data science, automation, etc.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","An interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine code. This allows for immediate execution and debugging.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers. Examples include if, else, for, while, def, etc.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","No, keywords cannot be used as variable names as they are reserved for specific syntactical purposes in the language.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created. Mutable objects can be modified, while immutable objects cannot.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","Lists are designed to be dynamic and allow modifications (adding, removing elements), while tuples are fixed in size and intended to be used as constant collections of items.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n","\n","== checks for value equality (whether two objects have the same value), while is checks for identity (whether two references point to the same object in memory).\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Logical operators include:\n","and: Returns True if both operands are true.\n","or: Returns True if at least one operand is true.\n","not: Returns True if the operand is false.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Type casting is the conversion of one data type to another. It can be done explicitly (using functions like int(), float(), str()) or implicitly by Python.\n","\n","10. How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","The elif statement allows checking multiple expressions for truth value. If the first condition is false, it checks the next condition, and so on.\n","\n","11. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","A for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list or range), while a while loop continues until a specified condition is false.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","The elif statement allows checking multiple expressions for truth value. If the first condition is false, it checks the next condition, and so on.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","A for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list or range), while a while loop continues until a specified condition is false.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, such as reading user input until a specific command is given.\n","\n","15. Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\"\n","\n"," print(\"Hello, World!\")\n"," ```\n","16. Write a Python program that displays your name and age.\n","\n"," name = \"Your Name\"\n"," age = 25\n"," print(f\"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.\")\n"," ```\n","17. Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library.\n","\n"," import keyword\n"," print(keyword.kwlist)\n"," ```\n","\n","18. Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword.\n","\n"," import keyword\n"," word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n"," print(f\"{word} is a keyword: {keyword.iskeyword(word)}\")\n"," ```\n","\n","19. Write a function to demonstrate the behavior of mutable and immutable arguments.\n","\n"," def mutable_immutable_demo(lst, tup):\n","     lst.append(4)  # Mutable\n","     # tup[0] = 4  # This will raise an error as tuples are immutable\n","     return lst\n","\n"," my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n"," my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n"," print(mutable_immutable_demo(my_list, my_tuple))\n"," ```\n","\n","20. Write a program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers.\n","\n"," a = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\n"," b = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n"," print(f\"Sum: {a + b}, Difference: {a - b}, Product: {a * b}, Quotient: {a / b}\")\n"," ```\n","\n","21. Write a program that demonstrates the use of logical operators.\n","\n"," a = True\n"," b = False\n"," print(f\"a and b: {a and b}, a or b: {a or b}, not a: {not a}\")\n"," ```\n","\n","22. Create a list and tuple in Python, and demonstrate how attempting to change an element works differently for each.\n","\n"," my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n"," my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n"," my_list[0] = 10  # This works\n"," # my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise an error\n"," print(my_list, my_tuple)\n"," ```\n","\n","23. Write a Python program to convert user input from string to integer, float, and boolean types.\n","\n"," user_input = input(\"Enter a number: \")\n"," int_value = int(user_input)\n"," float_value = float(user_input)\n"," bool_value = bool(user_input)\n"," print(f\"Integer: {int_value}, Float: {float_value}, Boolean: {bool_value}\")\n"," ```\n","\n","24.
